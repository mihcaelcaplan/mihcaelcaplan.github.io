<h1>Big idea board</h1>

<ol>
    <li><h3>Craft design production</h3></li>
    <ul>
        <li>I'm working on an ideal job for myself doing product design, prototyping, and small scale production planning.</li>
        <li>Want to work on production flows that can include the artisan in a scaled and balanced process that lets one work humanely, i.e. a manner that is good for the soul.</li>
        <li>Integrate with material recovery and value added recycling. </li>
    </ul>
    <li><h3>Productive machines</h3></li>
    <ul>
        <li>A (overly?) ambitious project to synthesize underutilized economic insight about capitalist production with underutilized industrial engineering and management concepts (Marx and Toyota).</li>
        <li>The project aims to create a formula or recipe for systems of work which raise the value of the input items.</li>
        <li>A given productive machine forms the skeleton of a capitalist enterprise, with which one may set in motion a circuit of capital to generate more cash out than put in.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<h2>Random things I thought of being interested in...</h2>

<ol>    
    <li><h3>Aluminum Extrusion</h3></li>
    <ul>
        <li>This process allows super simple forming of aluminum using a hydraulic ram and steel die set. The aluminum is preheated, but solid when it is forced through the steel die(s). The shape that comes out can be complex and functionally interesting.</li>
        <li>Would be interesting to make a) a small scale version of this process for shop level aluminum scrap recovery and extrusion processing. Raise the value thru production flow integrated with scrap sourcing to capture more value for the scrap collectors.</li>
        <li>Could it be done in-situ to create a "one-piece flow" for construction which eliminates the processing waste from classic commercial extrusion production?</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
