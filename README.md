# Michael's Personal Website 
This is the first real website I've ever spun up, even tho i've been dallying around with HTML since I was around 14 and first getting to know computers.

I **hope** you enjoy!

Built using Jekyll - necessary for github pages
really enjoyed using this engine - the liquid tags from Shopify make working with small scale static web content beautiful and intuitive.
