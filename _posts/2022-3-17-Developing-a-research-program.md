## What am I interested in?
I've been trying to figure out some possible strategic moves for my life. 

I realized that I really enjoy making things, and I also really enjoy knowing things. 

I have a pretty good idea of what I enjoy making, or at least what possible things I can see myself enjoying making. But it is much harder for me to figure out what I enjoy knowing. 

One way to think about it is in terms of what I enjoy _learning_. This is a widely accepted part of coming-to-know about something, so it's reasonable that you could discover what you enjoy knowing by thinking about what you enjoy learning. 

However, this type of thinking may be misleading. Perhaps you enjoyed learning about that particular subject because you were part of a _class_ where you liked the people, or the teacher, or the classroom for some reason. The point is that you might like learning about something for reasons unrelated to the topic that you are learning about. 

Thinking this way can also be difficult because of the sheer volume of things it is possible to know about. Each of those things takes a lot of time and energy to learn about, so it's not feasible to know everything. This might seem practically obvious, but it's an important part of the reasoning here that has thrown me off many times. In this case, the questions is not actually what I want to know, but what I want to know _the most_. 

## What am I interested in the most?
I am very bad with superlatives. I have a hard time weighing things against each other.
