The second work in my series about the conflict in Ukraine. The premise is the similar to the first: a collection of mobile phone videos. The focus is on the intonation of people's voices. Even if you don't understand the language, you can feel the emotion.

This work is slower, quieter. The video is crunchy, digital, hard to make out what is happening. 

The adrenaline, novelty, initial awe, have all worn off.
