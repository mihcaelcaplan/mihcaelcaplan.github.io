Sunset over the water <br>
Slipping down the east coast <br>
Stopping regionally in Rhode Island and Connecticut before arriving in New York <br>
At the new station, half heartedly connected to the old <br>
In the middle of constant construction <br>
I anticipate a contrast between the <br>
muted grey blue pink purple yellow orange sunset, and the <br>
buzzy sharp white LED station lighting that I will step into <br>


Slipping in and out of a light late afternoon sleep reading MIL-STD-1629A <br>
Environments: The conditions, circumstances, influences, stresses and combinations thereof, <br> surrounding and affecting systems or equipment during storage, handling, transportation, testing, <br> installation, and use in standby status and mission operation. <br>

I watched gulls flock around two bums lying in a pile of cold sleeping bags and trash <br>
In Boston <br>
The smaller birds knew what the styrofoam container promised, <br>
And they milled around, slipping on the frozen pavement and jumping back into the grey sky above <br>
But the container was empty, save a sugary sticky glaze of the sauce <br>
likely left over after lackluster noodles from the food court in the back of the station <br>

Above which I first learned the term “mezzanine” <br>
When i was 15, searching for a place to eat a McChicken <br>
Purchased directly next to that greasy Chinese stall <br>
while moving quickly, alone, from bus to bus or train <br>
Slipping in and out of my skin, shadowy against cold air and diesel fumes and street lights and bare branches <br>
