## Connecting things to other things

I decided to protoype the frame dimensions in PVC (keep your eyes out for that in the next dispatch). 

In order to do that, I printed an integrated PVC pipe holder from this model:

Of course, I took it off the printer and realized that I got the diameter of the circle wrong and no 1/2 inch PVC pipe would fit inside...

So I realized I needed a better way to attach things without reprinting the base plate every time. 

I decided on using a peg and hole system (is that the right name??). The pegs will look like this. A slot in the middle allows some flex which can afford a snug fit while keeping the tolerance which will allow it to release as well.

I printed three different hole sizes to test how the pegs mated.

The 5.5mm is way too tight. I could feel it binding when it started to go in, and I didn't want to repeat the first try I did where I could not pull the two pieces apart. 

The 5.7mm feels looser, but it still gets super tight at the end. I think this one is the winner, but I could run into issues removing the mated part. 

The 5.9mm hole is really easy to get the peg into, but I worry that it's too loose to ensure a secure fit. 

When the peg goes in the hole it mates tightly.

And the M5 bolt fits right through this assembly, designed to be a clearance hole!
