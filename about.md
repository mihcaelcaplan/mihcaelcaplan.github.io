I'm Michael, I study engineering and philosophy. I love learning, building things, and going on adventures. This website is a sort of digital portfolio, a way for you to get to know some of the things that I have done and the skills that I have.

I'm currently looking for a job! (check out my [resume](/assets/resume.pdf)).

Please contact me if you think that's the right thing to do! I like talking to people, and I'd love to hear about what you are up to:
