I'm Michael, an aspiring bird watcher and connoisseur of *vino* (that's the right way to say wine). I was born in a snowstorm, and I like to think you can see my origins in my rugged features.

I like working, and I want a job! (check out my [resume](/assets/resume.pdf)).

Call me @ 603-892-1038 if u think I'm **cute**.
