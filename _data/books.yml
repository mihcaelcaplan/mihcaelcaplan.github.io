- name: Intelligence and Spirit
  author: Reza Negarestani
  desc: Reza's smash succesor to Cyclonopedia. I really like this book, but maybe because I have a kink for not understanding what I'm reading. 

- name: Civilization and Capitalism
  author: Ferdinand Braudel
  desc: I haven't read much of this. Without intention, I have found myself in a niche where a lot of different authors I'm drawn to will reference Braudel. So it seems like I should read this, and it seems extremely well written, but it's hard to have energy to read about medieval civilization.

- name: 10,000 Years of Nonlinear History
  author: Manuel Delanda
  desc: One of the first books I read that approached its subject matter with what you could call a "systems" perspective. Very accessible and will introduce you to valuable analogical tools like autocatalysis, or chemical systems far from equilibrium. 

- name: "Technics and Time, 1: The Fault of Epimetheus"
  author: Bernard Stiegler
  desc: Fantastically written, makes you think about technology in an unfamiliar way. The classical allusions went over my head like usual, but overall very good book to elicit insights. 
  
- name: The Ant Trap
  author: Brian Epstein (no relation)
  desc: I remember loving this book when I read it in Sophomore year of college. I learned a Python module to simulate the interactions of agents, but never found the time to do much with it. One of my unexplored research interests is the design of complex dynamic (social?) systems by simulation. 

- name: Everything Must Go
  author: James Ladyman and Don Ross, David Spurrett, John G. Collier
  desc: Insanely dense book. A reference goldmine, but hard to get beyond Chapter 3. Definitely has a sense of giddiness and a bit of punk ethos which I like.
