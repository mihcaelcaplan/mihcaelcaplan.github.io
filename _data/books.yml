- name: A Study of the Toyota Production System (Produce What Is Needed, When It's Needed)
  author: Shigeo Shingo, Andrew P. Dillon
  desc: An in depth study of the industrial engineering concepts and logic behind the Toyota Production System. The author was the technical point person for the development of some truly amazing techniques in production. This book changed how I view making stuff, and rehabilitated hope in the industrial mode of production.

- name: Signal and Power Integrity
  author: Eric Bogatin
  desc: The best electrical engineering text. Long and full of wonderful language, it helps you to build intuition about the basic physical processes that underly design decisions. For anyone who will ever need to design a circuit board, I recommend reading at least the first chapters of this book. 

- name: Foundations of Mechanical Accuracy
  author: Wayne R. Moore
  desc: If you like machine tools, read this book. The author, a principal at the Connecticut based Moore Tool and Die company, talks about the fundamentals of making things straight. The techniques are ingeniously simple, developed before computers, but incredibly complex and specialized. 


- name: Intelligence and Spirit
  author: Reza Negarestani
  desc: Reza's smash succesor to Cyclonopedia. I really like this book, but maybe because I have a kink for not understanding what I'm reading. 

- name: Civilization and Capitalism
  author: Ferdinand Braudel
  desc: I haven't read much of this. Without intention, I have found myself in a niche where a lot of different authors I'm drawn to will reference Braudel. So it seems like I should read this, and it seems extremely well written, but it's hard to have energy to read about medieval civilization.

- name: 10,000 Years of Nonlinear History
  author: Manuel Delanda
  desc: One of the first books I read that approached its subject matter with what you could call a "systems" perspective. Very accessible and will introduce you to valuable analogical tools like autocatalysis, or chemical systems far from equilibrium. 

- name: "Technics and Time, 1: The Fault of Epimetheus"
  author: Bernard Stieglerthe
  desc: Fantastically written, makes you think about technology in an unfamiliar way. The classical allusions went over my head like usual, but overall very good book to elicit insights. 
  
- name: The Ant Trap
  author: Brian Epstein (no relation)
  desc: I remember loving this book when I read it in Sophomore year of college. I learned a Python module to simulate the interactions of agents, but never found the time to do much with it. One of my unexplored research interests is the design of complex dynamic (social?) systems by simulation. 

- name: Everything Must Go
  author: James Ladyman and Don Ross, David Spurrett, John G. Collier
  desc: Insanely dense book. A reference goldmine, but hard to get beyond Chapter 3. Definitely has a sense of giddiness and a bit of punk ethos which I like.
